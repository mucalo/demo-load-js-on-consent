            <h2>Scenario 1: Load Google Maps and use the callback parameter</h2>
            <p>This will load Google Maps and call the initMap function after loading is complete.</p>
            <button onclick="loadGoogleMaps();">Load GoogleMaps</button>

            <h2>Scenario 2: Append a script to the head element and just use it</h2>
            <p>This will append the script element to the head element, and attempt to use a function from it. Due to the asynchronous nature of JS, this will result with an Uncaught ReferenceError, as the script has not finished loading yet at the time it has been called.</p>
            <button onclick="loadMyScriptAndUseImmediately()">Load MyScript.js and use immediately</button>

            <h2>Scenario 3: Append a script to the head and supply the callback</h2>
            <p>This will append the script element to the head element, and add a callback function to its onload and onstagechange events. The callback function calls functions from MyScript.js and this works fine, as the callback is called once the script has been loaded.</p>
